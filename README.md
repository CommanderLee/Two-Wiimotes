Two-Wiimotes
============


Uses wiimotes to move the mouse pointer.

fastThreads.py is the one Julian edited so that it was smooth. 

separatingConstants.py is the one I modified which separated the constants and functions.

doXXXXXXX.py files are where the actual events/computation are handled. Remember to place all of these in a single folder.
